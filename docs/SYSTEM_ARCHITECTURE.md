# HexProperty Booking System Architecture

## 🏗 Architectural Overview

### Architectural Style
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

### Key Architectural Principles
- Immutable Domain Entities
- Strict Type Safety
- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Inversion
- Scalability
- Testability

## 🔍 System Components

### 1. Domain Layer
- Represents core business logic
- Contains domain entities, value objects
- Implements business rules and invariants
- Completely independent of infrastructure

#### Core Entities
- Property
- Building
- Zone
- Compound
- Location

### 2. Application Layer
- Orchestrates domain operations
- Implements use cases
- Coordinates between domain and infrastructure
- Contains application services

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- Implements technical capabilities
- Provides adapters for external systems
- Handles persistence, messaging, caching

#### Key Infrastructure Components
- Event Store
- Distributed Cache
- Logging Service
- Performance Optimizer
- GraphQL Error Handler

### 4. Presentation Layer
- GraphQL API
- Implements resolvers
- Handles request/response transformations

## 🌐 Communication Patterns

### Event-Driven Communication
- Domain Events
- Event Sourcing
- Pub/Sub Mechanism
- Eventual Consistency

### API Design
- GraphQL Schema
- Type-Safe Resolvers
- Advanced Error Handling
- Performance Optimized

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Serverless Deployment
- Google Cloud Platform
- Cloud Run
- Cloud Functions

- Event Store

## 🔒 Security Architecture
- Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)
- Service Account Per Component
- Encrypted Data at Rest
- Minimal Privilege Principle
- Secure Token Management

## 📊 Performance Characteristics
