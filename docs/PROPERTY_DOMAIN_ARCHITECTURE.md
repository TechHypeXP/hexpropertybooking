# Property Domain Architecture

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Property Domain architecture in the HexProperty Booking System.

## Domain Model Hierarchy
```
Location
│
└── Compound
    │
    └── Zone
        │
        └── Building
            │
            └── Property
```

## Key Design Principles
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Immutable Domain Entities
- Strict Type Safety
- Separation of Concerns

## Entity Responsibilities

### Location
- Geographical root entity
- Contains multiple compounds
- Manages location-level metadata
- Supports geospatial calculations

### Compound
- Groups zones within a location
- Manages shared facility access
- Supports inter-zone interactions

### Zone
- Contains buildings
- Manages access rules
- Handles facility management

### Building
- Contains properties
- Manages property collection
- Supports building-level metadata

### Property
- Atomic booking unit
- Represents individual rentable space
- Stores specific property attributes

## Event-Driven Workflow

### Event Types
1. Creation Events
2. Update Events
3. Deletion Events

### Event Handling
- Pub/Sub event bus
- Retry mechanism
- Dead-letter queue support
- Event sourcing capabilities

## Type Safety Strategies

### Branded Types
```typescript
type PropertyId = string & { readonly _brand: unique symbol };
type BuildingId = string & { readonly _brand: unique symbol };
```

### Runtime Validation
- Zod schema validation
- Comprehensive type checks
- Immutable entity design

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading
- Caching strategies
- Minimal object creation
- Efficient event processing

## Security Considerations
- Zone-based access control
- Immutable domain entities
- Event audit logging
- Secure event bus

## Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal scaling support
- Distributed event handling
- Stateless application services
- Event replay capabilities

## Best Practices
1. Always use domain events for state changes
2. Prefer immutable entities
3. Validate at domain entity creation
4. Use branded types for type safety
5. Implement comprehensive logging

## Example Usage

```typescript
const locationService = new LocationApplicationService();

const location = await locationService.createLocation(
  'loc-sf' as LocationId,
  'San Francisco',
  { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 },
  '123 Main St',
  [{
    compoundId: 'compound-1' as CompoundId,
    name: 'Downtown Residences',
    sharedFacilities: true,
    zones: [{
      zoneId: 'zone-a' as ZoneId,
      name: 'Residential Zone A',
      buildings: [{
        buildingId: 'building-1' as BuildingId,
        name: 'Tower A',
        properties: [{
          propertyId: 'prop-101' as PropertyId,
          bedrooms: 2,
          floor: 3,
          unit: 'A301'
        }]
      }]
    }]
  }]
);
```

## Future Roadmap
- Enhanced geospatial features
- Machine learning-based recommendations
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-tenant support
