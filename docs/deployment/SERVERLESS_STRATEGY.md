# HexProperty Booking Subsystem - Serverless Strategy
Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2024-01-10 14:45:23 GMT+2

## Current vs Serverless Architecture

### Booking Frontend Service
Current:
- Legacy PHP implementation
- Fixed server costs
- Limited scalability

Serverless (Cloud Run):
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Pay-per-request model
- Zero cold starts with min instances = 1 (production only)

### Booking Backend Services

#### Availability Service
- Cloud Run for API endpoints
- Cloud Functions for availability calculations
- Estimated $10-15/month

#### Reservation Service
- Cloud Run for booking API
- Cloud Functions for event processing
- Estimated $8-12/month

#### Access Control Service
- Cloud Run for QR/access endpoints
- Cloud Functions for access token generation
- Estimated $5-8/month

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Development & Testing
1. Availability service migration
2. Basic booking endpoints
3. Performance testing and cost analysis

### Phase 2: Staging Implementation
1. Complete booking service migration
2. Access control integration
3. Event-driven workflows setup

### Phase 3: Production Planning
1. Load testing with expected booking patterns
2. Cost analysis and optimization
3. Rollback procedures
4. High availability setup

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Cloud Run (Staging)
1. Min instances:
   - All services: 0 (cost optimization)
   - Max 2 instances per service
   - Memory: 256Mi
   - CPU: 0.5
   - Max concurrent requests: 6

### Cloud Functions
1. Memory allocation:
   - Availability check: 256MB
   - Booking processing: 256MB
   - Access token generation: 256MB

2. Execution timeouts:
   - API operations: 60s
   - Booking processing: 120s
   - Document generation: 180s

## Performance Considerations

### Cold Start Mitigation (Production Only)
1. Minimum instances for critical paths:
   - Booking API: 1
   - Availability API: 1
2. Optimized container sizes
3. Efficient dependency management

### Database Connections
1. Connection pooling
2. Lazy initialization
3. Connection reuse

## Monitoring Strategy

### Key Metrics
1. Booking response time
2. Availability check latency
3. Cold start frequency
4. Error rates
5. Concurrent bookings

### Alerts
1. Error rate > 1%
2. Response time > 2s
3. Failed bookings > 0.1%
4. Instance count at max

## Security Measures
1. Cloud IAP authentication
2. Service account per component
3. Encrypted data at rest
4. Secure service communication

## Cost Controls
1. Instance limits
2. Concurrency controls
3. Resource quotas
4. Budget alerts
