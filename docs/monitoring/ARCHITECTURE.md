# HexProperty Monitoring System Architecture

## Overview

The HexProperty Monitoring System is built on a hexagonal architecture with domain-driven design principles, providing a flexible and maintainable monitoring solution.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. Hexagonal Architecture
   - Domain Core
   - Provider Adapters
   - Infrastructure Layer

2. Domain-Driven Design
   - Bounded Contexts
   - Aggregates
   - Value Objects

3. Event-Driven Architecture
   - Event Publishing
   - Event Handling
   - Event Sourcing

## System Components

### 1. Domain Layer

```typescript
// Domain Monitors
PropertyMonitor
RecommendationMonitor
BookingMonitor
TenantMonitor

// Domain Types
Metric
HealthCheck
Span
ErrorEvent
```

### 2. Provider Layer

```typescript
// Base Provider
MonitoringProvider

// Implementations
StackdriverProvider
PrometheusProvider
```

### 3. Advanced Features

```typescript
// Processing
MetricBatchProcessor
PerformanceAnalyzer

// Management
AlertManager
MonitoringOptimizer
```

## Data Flow

1. Metric Collection
   ```
   Domain Monitor -> Batch Processor -> Provider -> Storage
   ```

2. Alert Processing
   ```
   Metric -> Alert Manager -> Notification -> Action
   ```

3. Performance Optimization
   ```
   Metrics -> Analyzer -> Optimizer -> Configuration
   ```

## Security Architecture

1. Authentication
   - Service Account Authentication
   - Role-Based Access Control
   - Token-Based Authorization

2. Data Protection
   - Encryption at Rest
   - Encryption in Transit
   - Data Masking

3. Compliance
   - Audit Logging
   - Data Retention
   - Access Control

## Deployment Architecture

1. Infrastructure
   ```
   Cloud Run -> Cloud Monitoring -> Cloud Storage
   ```

2. Scaling
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
   - Metric-Based Scaling
   - Load Balancing

3. Reliability
   - Multi-Region Deployment
   - Failover Mechanisms
   - Disaster Recovery

## Performance Considerations

1. Metric Processing
   - Batch Processing
   - Compression
   - Caching

2. Resource Usage
   - Memory Management
   - CPU Optimization
   - Network Efficiency

3. Scalability
   - Horizontal Scaling
   - Load Distribution
   - Resource Allocation

## Integration Points

1. External Systems
   - Google Cloud Platform
   - Prometheus
   - Alert Notification Systems

2. Internal Systems
   - Recommendation Engine
   - Booking System
   - Property Management

3. APIs
   - Metric Collection API
   - Alert Management API
   - Configuration API

## Future Considerations

1. Extensibility
   - New Providers
   - Additional Metrics
   - Enhanced Analytics

2. Scalability
   - Global Deployment
   - Increased Load
   - New Use Cases

3. Features
   - Machine Learning Integration
   - Predictive Analytics
   - Advanced Visualization

## Decision Log

1. Architecture Decisions
   - Hexagonal Architecture: Flexibility and maintainability
   - Domain-Driven Design: Complex domain modeling
   - Event-Driven: Real-time processing

2. Technology Choices
   - TypeScript: Type safety and developer experience
   - Cloud Run: Serverless and scalable
   - Terraform: Infrastructure as code

3. Provider Selection
   - Stackdriver: Primary GCP integration
   - Prometheus: Open-source alternative
   - Multiple Providers: Vendor flexibility
