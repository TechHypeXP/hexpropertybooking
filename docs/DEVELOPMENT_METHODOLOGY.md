# HexProperty Development Methodology

## 🚀 Methodology Overview
A structured, iterative approach to software development combining best practices from Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development, and Agile methodologies.

## 🔄 Three-Iteration Methodology

### 1. STOP (Analysis Phase)
- Comprehensive requirement gathering
- Current system state evaluation
- Identify constraints and opportunities
- Stakeholder consultation
- Risk assessment

#### Key Activities
- Domain exploration
- Technical feasibility study
- Performance baseline
- Security review

### 2. THINK (Design Phase)
- Solution architecture design
- Technology stack evaluation
- Comparative analysis
- Architectural decision records
- Prototype development

#### Decision Criteria
- Scalability
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Security
- Cost-effectiveness

### 3. REITERATE (Implementation Phase)
- Incremental feature development
- Continuous integration
- Automated testing
- Performance optimization
- Feedback incorporation

#### Implementation Principles
